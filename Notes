In general, when you have account name <account name> and repository name <repository name>:

after modifying settings as:
Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Branch > Set to: main, Set to: /(root)

it will create a project webpage at https://<account name>.github.io/<project name>
Note that index.htm file will take over README.md

For example, account name is tonytanakorn, project name is SSOT.
After modifying the settings of repository SSOT,
we have a webpage at tonytanakorn.github.io/SSOT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a special case where the repository is named <account name>.github.io
and the setting is modified the same way as desribed,
it will create an account webpage at https://<account name>.github.io

For example, account nae is tonytanakorn.
After modifying the settings of repository tonytanakorn.github.io,
we have a webpage at tonytanakorn.github.io
